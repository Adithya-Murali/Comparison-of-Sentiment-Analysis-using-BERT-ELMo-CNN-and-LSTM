# Final-Year-Project
The final year project as part of our Bachelor of Technology(BTech) program done by our team of 4 (Harikrishnan R, Saurav James Zacahrias, Jislin Varghese and me) in academic year 2018-19


Our project is  a comparison of performance on sentiment analysis task by:
    Some of the established deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, LSTM-CNN)
    Single layer NN using ELMo embedding
    BERT
    
I have shared the code as well as our final year report.

Please keep in mind that this was our first experience in DL and the project may have faults.
